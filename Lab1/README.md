# Machine Learning Lab: Housing Price Data Analysis

## Project Overview
### Implement Linear Regression Model Using US Housing Data


#### Import the required Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn packages
1. Load the US Housing data into a dataframe using pandas
2. Check the data types of each feature(column) in the dataset.
3. Generate a summary of the dataset for min, max, stddev,
quartile vales for 25%,50%,75%,90%,
4. List the names of columns/features in the dataset
5. Generate a pairplot of the features of the dataset.
6. Generate a correlation matrix and heatmap for the features
7. Create a list of dependent variable to independent variables to understand regression
among the features. From the data include Price to other numerical variables of the
Housing data.
